Breast Cancer Diagnostic Analysis Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately diagnose breast cancer using a dataset of breast cancer patient records. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and optimization.

Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of several features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. Features include characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. The objective is to classify the diagnosis as either benign or malignant.
